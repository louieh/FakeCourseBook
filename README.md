# Fake Coursebook

[Fakecoursebook](https://fakecoursebook.info) is a course information query tool for UTD students that is more usable than [UTD's CourseBook](https://coursebook.utdallas.edu/).

* Provide higher query response speed, a simple and intuitive UI, and more convenient ways to query and links and sortable results.

* Visualize the semester data for the past decade and make full use of historical data to present more comprehensive and valuable information, implemented by [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/).



#### Two main kinds of pages:

* [Course page](https://fakecoursebook.info/course/CS%205333)
  * Course description
  * Professors charts for each semester
  * Elective status charts
  * Grade distribution charts
* [Professor page](https://fakecoursebook.info/professor/Jorge%20Cobb)
  * Links about the professor
  * Courses charts for each semester
  * Elective status charts
  * Grade distribution charts
